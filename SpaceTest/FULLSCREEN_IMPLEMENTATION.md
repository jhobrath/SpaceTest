# Fullscreen Implementation

## Overview
The game now runs in fullscreen mode by default and dynamically adapts to any screen resolution. The display system uses responsive positioning to ensure proper gameplay across different monitor sizes.

## Features Added

### **??? Automatic Fullscreen**
- Game starts in fullscreen mode automatically
- Uses monitor's native resolution for optimal display
- Maintains proper aspect ratios and proportions

### **?? Display Controls**
- **F11** - Toggle between fullscreen and windowed mode
- **Escape** - Exit the game
- Controls displayed on-screen for user reference

### **?? Dynamic Scaling**
- All UI elements position themselves based on actual screen dimensions
- Player positions calculate relative to screen size
- Power-ups spawn across the full width of the screen
- Projectile bounds checking works with any resolution

## Technical Implementation

### **Initialization Changes**
- Gets monitor dimensions using `Raylib.GetMonitorWidth(0)` and `Raylib.GetMonitorHeight(0)`
- Initializes window with full monitor resolution
- Automatically toggles to fullscreen mode

### **Responsive Positioning**
- Player ships positioned relative to screen edges
- UI elements use dynamic positioning (health bars, winner text)
- Power-up spawning adapts to screen width
- Control instructions positioned at screen bottom

### **Dynamic Bounds**
- Projectiles use `Raylib.GetScreenWidth()` for edge detection
- Power-ups use `Raylib.GetScreenHeight()` for cleanup
- Wall projectiles stick to actual screen edges

## Resolution Support

### **Tested Resolutions**
- Works with any monitor resolution
- Maintains gameplay balance across different aspect ratios
- UI scales appropriately for both 16:9 and 21:9 displays

### **Multi-Monitor Support**
- Uses primary monitor (monitor 0) by default
- Can be modified to support specific monitor selection

## Benefits
